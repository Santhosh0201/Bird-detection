# Bird-detection
Detection of bird using Tiny Yolo and GoogleNet Architecture.

    The birds application is a bird recognition and classification program. 
    It uses both the NCS along with TinyYolo and GoogLeNet to take an image and first get bounding boxes for birds in the image and then uses GoogLeNet to further classify the birds found.
